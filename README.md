# Absenteeism At Work Analysis

## The Goal: 
### To predict the total hours people are absent by applying regression models to better understand underlying variables.

## About the data set and the analysis: 
The data set was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil. The creators, original owner and donors are: Andrea Martiniano (1), Ricardo Pinto Ferreira (2), and Renato Jose Sassi (3).
This data set (Absenteeism at work - Part I) was used in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho - Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management. A paper (Application of a neuro fuzzy network in prediction of absenteeism at work) was publised based on the study of this data set.
This data set inludes 21 features with different attribute types. I decide to narrow down the number of features and use them to predict the absenteesim time (in hours) at work by applying different regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest). At the end, by comparing the RMSE rates from different models to have a general idea about which model is a better fit for this data set and which features play more important roles when predicting the absenteesim hours at work.
